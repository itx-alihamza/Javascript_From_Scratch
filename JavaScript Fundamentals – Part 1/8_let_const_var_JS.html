        //What is let, const and var?
        //let:
        //let is a block-scoped variable declaration keyword in JavaScript.
        //variables declared with let can be reassigned but not redeclared.
        //const:
        //const is a block-scoped variable declaration keyword in JavaScript.
        //variables declared with const must be assigned a value when they are declared.
        //variables declared with const cannot be reassigned.
        //var:
        //var is a function-scoped variable declaration keyword in JavaScript.
        //variables declared with var can be reassigned and redeclared.

        //block-scoped:
        //A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces.
        //A block-scoped variable is a variable that is only accessible within the block it is defined.

        //Function-scoped:
        //A function is a block of code that is defined once but may be executed or invoked any number of times.
        //A function-scoped variable is a variable that is only accessible within the function it is defined.
