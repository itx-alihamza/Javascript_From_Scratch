            1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some
            countries have multiple languages, but just choose one)
            2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never
            change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.
            3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens*/

        const language = 'Urdu';
        const country = 'Pakistan';
        console.log(language);
        console.log(country);

        let population = 2300000;
        console.log(population);

        //Modifying population value

        console.log('Modified populaiotn value:', population);
