        //Operators:
        //Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values.

        //Arithmetic Operators:
        //Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on numbers.
        //Addition(+), Subtraction(-), Multiplication(*), Division(/), Exponentiation(**), Modulus(%), Increment(++), Decrement(--).

        //Assignment Operators:
        //Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
        //Addition assignment(x += y), Subtraction assignment(x -= y), Multiplication assignment(x *= y), Division assignment(x /= y), Remainder assignment(x %= y).

        //Comparison Operators:
        //Comparison operators are used to compare two values.
        //Equal to(==), Not equal to(!=), Greater than(>), Less than(<), Greater than or equal to(>=), Less than or equal to(<=).

        //Logical Operators:
        //Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.
        //Logical AND(&&), Logical OR(||), Logical NOT(!).

        //Math operator 
        const now = 2027;
        const ageAli = now - 1823;
        const ageSunny = now - 2014;
        console.log(ageAli, ageSunny);

        console.log(ageAli * 2, ageSunny / 10, 2 ** 4);
        //2 ** 4 means 2 to the power of 4 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 16

        const firstName = 'Ali';
        const lastName = 'Hamza';
        console.log(firstName + ' ' + lastName);

        //Assignment Operator
        let x = 13 + 2;
        x += 23;//x = x + 23
        x *= 2;//x = x * 2
        x++;//x = x + 1
        x--;//x = x - 1
        console.log(x);
        //Comparison Opearator
        console.log(ageAli > ageSunny);
        console.log(ageSunny >= 18);

        const isFullAge = ageSunny >= 18;

        console.log(now - 1823 > now - 2014);
