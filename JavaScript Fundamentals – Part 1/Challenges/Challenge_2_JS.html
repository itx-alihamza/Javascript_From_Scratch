        /*Coding Challenge #2
            Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and
            improve it.
            Your tasks:
            1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message
            is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
            2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
            BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
            Hint: Use an if/else statement �
            GOOD LUCK � */
