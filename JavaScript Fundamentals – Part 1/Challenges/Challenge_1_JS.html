        /*Coding Challenge #1
            Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
            calculated using the formula:
            BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
            and height in meter).
            Your tasks:
            1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
            2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
            versions)
            3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
            whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
            Test data:
            § Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
            m tall.
            § Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
            m tall.
            GOOD LUCK �*/
