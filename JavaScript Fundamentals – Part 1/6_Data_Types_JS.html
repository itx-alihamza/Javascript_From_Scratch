        //Value Types:
        //value types are the types of data that are stored in the memory and are accessed by their actual value
        // Primitive data types in JavaScript are the most basic data types that are built into the language.
        // They represent simple values and are not objects. The primitive data types in JavaScript include:
        // - Number: Represents numeric values (both integers and floating-point numbers).
        // - String: Represents sequences of characters.
        // - Boolean: Represents logical values, true or false.
        // - Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
        // - Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
        // - Symbol: Represents a unique identifier (added in ECMAScript 2015).
        // - BigInt: Represents whole numbers larger than the largest number JavaScript can reliably represent with the Number primitive (added in ECMAScript 2020).

        // Examples of each primitive data type in JavaScript

        //typeof operator;
        //   is used to get the data type of a variable or a value

        let money = 23000;
        console.log(money);
        console.log(typeof money);

        money = 'Twenty three thousand';
        console.log(money);
        console.log(typeof money);

        money = true;
        console.log(money);
        console.log(typeof money);

        money = undefined;//here
        console.log(money);
